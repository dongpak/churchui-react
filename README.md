This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The Church Clerk application UI interacts with number of Microservices running in the backend behind
API Gateway.  The backend Microservices running in Docker Swarm as services.  See other projects like 
apigateway, userapi, and churchapi.  More Microservices will be added to this archtiecture in support of
church clerks.

This UI written using React framework applies React Context to share key data among components.
Uses [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) to call REST API supplied by Microservices.
